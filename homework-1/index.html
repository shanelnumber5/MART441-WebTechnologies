      <p>
        Honestly, I believe the biggest issue that faces us today is how COVID is going to affect our American education system for years to come. I try to think about things optimistically but being part of equation the last few years as a teacher
        has really frightened me in many ways. I fear the lack of funding and the huge workloads on staff and teachers are unmanageable to sustain in real life. Schools have taken on way too many roles in our student’s lives and no one can do it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently confronting much of what is going on, by occasionally subbing in the nearby schools and trying to make an impact in this small community because that is within my capabilities. My husband is also looking at breaking apart
        beliefs in education in his doctoral program for his thesis. We believe we have made small steps and improvements, but really there is still tons of work to accomplish.
